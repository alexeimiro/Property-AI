# TypeScript to JavaScript Migration

This project was converted from TypeScript (TSX) to JavaScript (JSX). Below is a summary of the changes made:

## Configuration Files

1. Replaced `tsconfig.json` with `jsconfig.json`
2. Replaced `tailwind.config.ts` with `tailwind.config.js`
3. Updated `vite.config.ts` to `vite.config.js`
4. Updated `eslint.config.js` to work with JavaScript/JSX instead of TypeScript/TSX
5. Updated `components.json` to use JSX instead of TSX

## File Conversions

1. Converted all `.tsx` files to `.jsx` files
2. Converted all `.ts` files to `.js` files
3. Removed TypeScript type annotations (note: runtime type checking is no longer available)
4. Updated import statements to reference `.jsx` and `.js` files instead of `.tsx` and `.ts` files

## Benefits of the Migration

1. Simpler development environment
2. Faster development iterations
3. Reduced complexity for developers who are more familiar with JavaScript

## Potential Issues

When working with the converted codebase, keep in mind:

1. Type checking is no longer available at compile time
2. PropTypes can be used for runtime validation if needed
3. Some TypeScript-specific features like generics, interfaces, and enums are no longer available

## Scripts

Several PowerShell scripts were created to assist with the migration:

1. `convert-ts-to-js.ps1`: Converted TypeScript files to JavaScript
2. `update-imports.ps1`: Updated import statements in the converted files
3. `cleanup-ts-files.ps1`: Removed the original TypeScript files

## Future Improvements

To further improve the codebase:

1. Consider adding PropTypes for runtime type validation
2. Implement JSDoc comments with type annotations for better editor support
3. Set up good testing practices to catch type errors early
